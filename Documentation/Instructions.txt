Battleboats Game Instructions:

Objective:
Sink all of your opponent's battleboats before they sink yours!

Setup:

    Each player arranges their battleboats on their grid.
    You can select where to place the boats using either the WASD or Arrow Keys.
    The boats can be rotated with the 'R' Key.
    To place a boat, press Enter.

Gameplay:

    At the start of the player turn, the player can choose to shoot at any square that has not already been shot at.
    you can select your target using the WASD or Arrow Keys.
    To Fire, press Enter.
    If you hit a boat, the tile will change to the corresponding colour. Likewise will occur if you miss.
    If you sink a boat, the entire boat will change colour to that which corresponds to a wreckage.

    The Computer will then take its turn, repeating the same steps as the player.

Rules:

    Once a battleboat is hit in all its squares, it is considered sunk.
    The first player to sink all of their opponent's battleboats wins the game.

Misc:

    at any time, the player may press escape in order to save progress and return to the game menu, where they may view these instructions again or quit.
